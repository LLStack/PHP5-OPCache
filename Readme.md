Because the LSPHP package provided by LiteSpeedTech is under the Ubuntu distribution, OPCache support is not provided for PHP5.3 ~ 5.6. Here is the source package.

> PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 are from the zendopcache-7.0.5 package provided by PECL.
> PHP 5.5 comes from the `ext` directory in the php-5.5.38 source package.
> PHP 5.6 comes from the `ext` directory in the php-5.6.40 source package.
